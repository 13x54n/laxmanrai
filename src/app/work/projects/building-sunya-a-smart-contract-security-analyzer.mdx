## Overview

Built a smart static vulnerability analyzer for Starknet and EVM-compatible smart contracts. Prevents production crashes through automated detection, seamless tooling, and blockchain-integrated audits with transparent IPFS storage.

## Key Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection**: Trained custom ML model on Caracal datasets for Starknet contracts; integrated Slither for EVM analysis—delivering smarter, dataset-driven insights.
- **Smart Resource Management**: Auto-assigns tasks to available core memory, clears temp storage post-analysis, and detects Starknet vs. EVM project configs instantly.
- **Plug-and-Play Tooling**: Automatically installs dependencies and tools—no version conflicts or manual setup required.
- **Dashboard Integrations**: Pulls real-time data from Voyager (Starknet), Etherscan (Ethereum), Herodotus (storage proofs), and Tokenflow (tx/events) for full visibility.
- **Gas Tank Meta-Transactions**: Powers seamless, gasless blockchain writes via ArgentX and Dynamic Wallet with multi-sig support—making dApp interactions frictionless.
- **Audit Reporting & Minting**: Exports PDF reports; mints audits to IPFS-backed registry with L1/L2 event monitoring for verification.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite.js + React**: Interactive dashboard for users, devs, and security teams.
- **Scarb**: Starknet contract build/deploy tooling.
- **Slither**: EVM static vulnerability analysis.
- **ArgentX & Dynamic Wallet**: Meta-tx, multi-sig, gasless interactions.
- **IPFS (Lighthouse)**: Decentralized audit report storage.
- **Nethermind Extension**: Local Audit Registry contract testing.
- **APIs**: Voyager, Etherscan, Herodotus, Tokenflow.

## Challenges and Learnings

Key challenge: Cross-chain compatibility (Starknet/EVM) with resource-heavy analysis, minus user friction. Solved via auto-detection, specialized ML training, and dependency automation. Mastered secure dApp patterns through real-time listeners and meta-tx integration.

## Outcome

**StarkHack (EthGlobal) Winner**: Voyager API Prize, Dynamic Pool, Herodotus Best Storage Proof API.  
Delivers production-grade security, transparent ownership proofs, and 80% faster audits—now battle-tested for real-world smart contract protection.
