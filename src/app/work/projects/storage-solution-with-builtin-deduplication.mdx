## Overview

User-friendly decentralized storage platform built on IPFS and Filecoin with deduplication benchmarking and optional ERC721 proof-of-ownership. Transforms simple file uploads into monetizable NFT digital collectibles.

## Key Features

- **Secure Decentralized Storage**: File uploads stored on IPFS/Filecoin with intelligent deduplication benchmarking for optimal storage efficiency.
- **Fast CDN Delivery**: Fleek-powered CDN ensures lightning-fast image and asset delivery worldwide.
- **Human-Readable Naming**: ENS integration provides intuitive, memorable names for files and digital assets.
- **NFT Marketplace**: Convert stored assets into ERC721 NFTs tradable across multiple blockchain networks.
- **Multi-Chain Interoperability**: Seamless cross-chain NFT marketplace access for maximum liquidity and reach.
- **No-Code Web3**: Complete Web3 functionality accessible without technical expertise—BUIDL for humans.

## Technologies Used

- **IPFS & Filecoin**: Core decentralized storage infrastructure with deduplication optimization.
- **Fleek**: Hosting and global CDN for fast content delivery.
- **ENS**: Human-readable naming system for intuitive asset management.
- **ERC721**: NFT standard for proof-of-ownership and marketplace integration.
- **Multi-Chain**: Cross-blockchain NFT marketplace compatibility.

## Challenges and Learnings

Balancing decentralized storage reliability with CDN performance required sophisticated deduplication algorithms and caching strategies. ENS integration simplified UX dramatically while maintaining Web3 security. Multi-chain NFT marketplace required deep understanding of cross-chain bridging and liquidity pools.

## Outcome

**HackFS 2024 (EthGlobal) - Filecoin Honorable Mention Winner**.  
Empowers non-technical users to securely store files, access them globally via CDN, and monetize as NFTs across chains. Delivers production-ready decentralized storage with marketplace functionality.
