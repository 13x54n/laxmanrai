## Overall Structure and Goals for the Week

By the end of this week, you should be able to:

- Solve JS coding exercises in 20–30 minutes using just a text editor and console.  
- Confidently explain variables, scope, functions, arrays (map/filter/reduce), objects, promises, async/await, and basic type coercion.  
- Implement and explain: a custom `map`, grouping even/odd numbers, removing duplicates, filtering users, deep cloning, closures, and converting callbacks to promises.  
- Walk through core conceptual interview questions from a modern JS interview list. [Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUTbEcO-lrk)

Primary practice sources:

- GeeksforGeeks – “JavaScript Fundamentals Coding Practice Problems.” [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-fundamentals-coding-practice-problems/)
- GeeksforGeeks – “JavaScript Exercises, Practice Questions and Solutions” by topic. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/practice-javascript-online/)

- A 2025‑style JavaScript interview questions collection (e.g., GeeksforGeeks/CodeSignal/Intellipaat). [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-interview-questions/)

Rule for the whole week:  
For each topic:

1. Read 10–15 min maximum.  
2. Code 60–90 min (solutions closed at first).  
3. Only then compare with provided solutions and adjust. [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-functions-exercises.php)

***

## Day 1 (Mon): Core JS Fundamentals – Variables, Types, Control Flow

**Goal:** Refresh pure basics so the rest of the week is easier.

### 1. Warm‑up: Syntax and basic problems

- Spend ~20–30 minutes on GeeksforGeeks “JavaScript Fundamentals Coding Practice Problems” basic questions such as add two numbers, if/else, even or odd, positive/negative, basic strings. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-fundamentals-coding-practice-problems/)
- Do 5–8 problems directly in your editor (not online only), and run with Node or the browser console.

Key ideas to focus on:

- `let` vs `const` vs `var` and block/function scope.  
- Primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint) vs objects. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-interview-questions/)
- `if/else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, `break`/`continue` patterns. [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php)

### 2. Concept drill (15–20 min)

Use a modern interview question list (2025‑style) and answer out loud or in notes: [codesignal](https://codesignal.com/blog/25-javascript-interview-questions-and-answers-from-basic-to-senior-level/)

- What is JavaScript, typical uses, and how it runs (single‑threaded, interpreted/ JIT).  
- Difference between `let`, `var`, and `const`.  
- Data types, `typeof`, `null` vs `undefined`.  
- What is hoisting? Give a simple example.

Don’t worry about perfect wording yet; just make sure you can explain clearly.

### 3. Small project idea (optional, 30–45 min)

Build a **simple CLI calculator**:

- Ask for two numbers and an operator (`+ - * /`).  
- Use `if` or `switch` to compute and log the result.  
- Add basic validation (e.g., division by zero, non‑number input).

This glues your fundamentals together.

***

## Day 2 (Tue): Arrays and Objects – Real‑World Data Handling

**Goal:** Get very comfortable with arrays and objects, including `map`, `filter`, `reduce`.

### 1. Arrays and objects practice (60–90 min)

Use GeeksforGeeks “JavaScript Exercises, Practice Questions and Solutions” sections for Numbers, Arrays, and Objects. Also mix a few w3resource basic tasks. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/practice-javascript-online/)

Focus on problems like:

- Create and access arrays, push/pop, slice/splice.  
- Iterate over arrays: `for`, `for...of`, `forEach`.  
- Basic object creation, property access, adding/removing fields, iterating over keys. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/practice-javascript-online/)

Aim for:

- 5–7 array exercises.  
- 3–5 object exercises.

Again, write in your own editor, then compare with reference solutions. [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php)

### 2. Interview‑style tasks for the day

Implement and test:

1. **Group numbers into even/odd**

```js
function groupEvenOdd(numbers) {
  const result = { even: [], odd: [] };
  for (const n of numbers) {
    if (n % 2 === 0) result.even.push(n);
    else result.odd.push(n);
  }
  return result;
}
```

Then extend:

- Handle non‑numeric values (ignore or throw).  
- Write 2–3 test arrays in code and log outputs.

2. **Given array of users, return names of users older than 25**

```js
function getNamesOver25(users) {
  return users
    .filter(u => u.age > 25)
    .map(u => u.name);
}
```

Then:

- Change the threshold.  
- Add a `city` filter.  
- Practice writing this without `filter`/`map` first, then rewrite using them.

These mirror real interview tasks combining array methods and callback logic. [codesignal](https://codesignal.com/blog/25-javascript-interview-questions-and-answers-from-basic-to-senior-level/)

***

## Day 3 (Wed): Functions, Scope, `this`, Closures

**Goal:** Understand functions deeply: declarations, expressions, arrow functions, `this`, and closures.

### 1. Functions practice (45–60 min)

Use w3resource “JavaScript functions – Exercises, Practice, Solution” (there are ~145 problems) for short function problems, like reverse a number, check palindrome, etc. [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-functions-exercises.php)

- Solve 4–6 **small** function exercises.  
- Pay attention to parameters, return values, and avoiding global variables.

Then, add 2–3 callback‑style tasks from GeeksforGeeks’ “Functions” practice section. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/practice-javascript-online/)

### 2. Concept drill: scope, `this`, and closures (30–40 min)

From a 2025 interview questions set, review and answer: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX48mv73jf8)

- What is scope (global, function, block)?  
- Difference between function declarations and function expressions.  
- What is `this` in:  
  - A regular function on an object.  
  - A standalone function in strict mode.  
  - An arrow function.  
- What is a closure? Provide a simple example.

Then implement:

```js
function createCounter(start = 0) {
  let value = start;
  return function() {
    value++;
    return value;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter(5);
console.log(counter()); // 6
console.log(counter()); // 7
```

Explain in your own words:

- Why `value` is remembered between calls.  
- How this pattern is useful (e.g., encapsulating state, rate‑limiting, caching).

Many modern JS interview resources emphasize closures, higher‑order functions, and `this` as core differentiators. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX48mv73jf8)

***

## Day 4 (Thu): Implementing `map`, Removing Duplicates, Deep Clone

**Goal:** Build your own versions of common patterns and understand shallow vs deep copy.

### 1. Implement your own `myMap` (45–60 min)

Task: Implement `myMap` that behaves like `Array.prototype.map`.

Steps:

1. Write a simple function:

```js
function myMap(arr, callback) {
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    result.push(callback(arr[i], i, arr));
  }
  return result;
}
```

2. Test it with:

- Doubling numbers.  
- Converting strings to uppercase.  
- Extracting a property from an array of objects.

3. Compare to how MDN or practice sites describe `map`—they pass `(element, index, array)`, and return a new array. [codesignal](https://codesignal.com/blog/25-javascript-interview-questions-and-answers-from-basic-to-senior-level/)

Explain out loud:

- Why `map` is a higher‑order function.  
- How this relates to functional programming patterns you see in modern JS.

### 2. Remove duplicates from an array (without `Set`) (45–60 min)

Goal: Implement two approaches:

1. Using an object or `Map` to track seen elements.  
2. Using `filter` and `indexOf`.

Example:

```js
function unique(arr) {
  const seen = {};
  const result = [];
  for (const item of arr) {
    if (!seen[item]) {
      seen[item] = true;
      result.push(item);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

Test with:

- All numbers.  
- Mixed data (numbers, strings).  
- Already unique arrays.

Then check similar tasks on GeeksforGeeks / w3resource (they often include “remove duplicates” in arrays or strings). [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-functions-exercises.php)

### 3. Deep clone basics (30–40 min)

Use your practice sources and interview questions to understand shallow vs deep copying. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-interview-questions/)

Implement:

- A **shallow** copy with `Object.assign` or spread.  
- A very simple **deep clone** function that:  
  - Handles primitives.  
  - Handles plain objects.  
  - Handles arrays.

For example:

```js
function deepClone(value) {
  if (value === null || typeof value !== 'object') return value;
  if (Array.isArray(value)) {
    return value.map(deepClone);
  }
  const result = {};
  for (const key in value) {
    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(value, key)) {
      result[key] = deepClone(value[key]);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

Test by modifying nested fields in the clone and confirming the original doesn’t change.

Shallow vs deep copy, and how they relate to mutation bugs, is a frequent topic in JavaScript interview guides. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX48mv73jf8)

***

## Day 5 (Fri): Type Coercion, `==` vs `===`, and Bug Hunting

**Goal:** Be able to explain JS quirks clearly and avoid common pitfalls.

### 1. Study type coercion and equality (30–40 min)

From an interview questions resource, focus on: [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-interview-questions/)

- Difference between `==` and `===`.  
- How JavaScript coerces values in comparisons, especially with `==`.  
- `NaN`, `isNaN`, `Number.isNaN`.  

Write your own examples:

```js
console.log(0 == false);   // true
console.log(0 === false);  // false
console.log('' == 0);      // true
console.log('' === 0);     // false
console.log(null == undefined); // true
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

Explain:

- Why these happen (coercion rules).  
- Why you should prefer `===` in almost all cases.

### 2. “Bug demo” exercise (45–60 min)

Write a small piece of code that **breaks** because of `==`, then fix it with `===`.

Example:

```js
function isEmpty(input) {
  // BAD: uses ==
  return input == null;
}

console.log(isEmpty(0));      // false (ok)
console.log(isEmpty(''));     // false (ok)
console.log(isEmpty(null));   // true
console.log(isEmpty(undefined)); // true

// Now create a subtle bug:
const userInput = 0;
if (!isEmpty(userInput)) {
  console.log('Processing:', userInput);
}
```

Then discuss how over‑relying on `==` could misclassify values in more complex cases, and rewrite with `===` and explicit checks.

This mirrors the type‑coercion style questions in 2025 interview lists. [codesignal](https://codesignal.com/blog/25-javascript-interview-questions-and-answers-from-basic-to-senior-level/)

### 3. Quick practice on “basic/advanced JS” (30–45 min)

Do a small set (3–5 questions) from GeeksforGeeks’ JavaScript interview page or CodeSignal’s JS list focusing on coercion, scope, and basics. [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/javascript-interview-questions/)

Write answers in your own words, then compare.

***

## Day 6 (Sat): Async – Callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`

**Goal:** Be able to move between callback style, promises, and `async/await` and explain each.

### 1. Learn/review async concepts (30–45 min)

From a modern JS interview questions resource, review: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX48mv73jf8)

- What callbacks are; callback hell.  
- What a Promise is (pending, fulfilled, rejected).  
- How `then`/`catch` work.  
- How `async`/`await` sits on top of promises.  
- Basic idea of the event loop (just enough to explain why async code works the way it does).

### 2. Convert a callback‑based function to a Promise (45–60 min)

Start with a fake callback‑style API:

```js
function fetchUserCallback(id, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (id === 0) {
      callback(new Error('Invalid ID'));
    } else {
      callback(null, { id, name: 'Alice' });
    }
  }, 500);
}
```

Now write:

```js
function fetchUserPromise(id) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fetchUserCallback(id, (err, data) => {
      if (err) reject(err);
      else resolve(data);
    });
  });
}
```

Test:

```js
fetchUserPromise(1)
  .then(user => console.log('User:', user))
  .catch(err => console.error('Error:', err.message));
```

Then write an `async` function:

```js
async function showUser(id) {
  try {
    const user = await fetchUserPromise(id);
    console.log('User:', user);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err.message);
  }
}
```

Call `showUser(1)` and `showUser(0)`; read the outputs.

This pattern—wrapping callbacks in promises and using `async/await`—is directly in line with modern interview prep for asynchronous JavaScript. [codesignal](https://codesignal.com/blog/25-javascript-interview-questions-and-answers-from-basic-to-senior-level/)

### 3. Extra practice from sources (30–45 min)

From w3resource and GeeksforGeeks, pick a couple of exercises that touch async or timers (`setTimeout`, basic promise usage) if available. [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-functions-exercises.php)

If your chosen list is more conceptual, write your own:

- A function that simulates fetching multiple users in series with `await`.  
- A function that runs two promises in parallel using `Promise.all`.

***

## Day 7 (Sun): Integration, Mock Interview, and Review

**Goal:** Pull everything together and make sure you can both code and explain what you did.

### 1. Integration mini‑project (60–90 min)

Build a small “user management” script that uses most of the concepts:

- Start with an array of user objects `{ id, name, age }`.  
- Functions to:  
  - Get names over a certain age (arrays + filter/map).  
  - Group users into over/under 25.  
  - Remove duplicate users by `id`.  
- A `deepCloneUsers` function using your deep clone logic.  
- A fake async `fetchUser` using promises/async that returns a user by id with delay and error handling.

This could live in a single file, and you run it a few times to check outputs.

### 2. Mock interview session (~45–60 min)

Pick 8–10 questions from a 2025 JS interview list that cover: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX48mv73jf8)

- Data types, `let/var/const`, hoisting.  
- `==` vs `===`, type coercion examples.  
- Arrays vs objects, `map`/`filter`/`reduce`.  
- Closures and `this` vs arrow functions.  
- Promises and `async/await`.  
- Shallow vs deep copy.

Answer them out loud while screen‑sharing your code (even if it’s just for yourself). Time yourself: 2–3 minutes per question.

### 3. Week review and next steps (30–45 min)

Reflect and write down:

- Which coding tasks still feel slow or confusing (deep clone, closures, async)?  
- Which type of questions you consistently miss or hesitate on.  
- One concrete focus for next week (e.g., “More practice with async patterns and error handling,” or “Strengthen DOM + browser APIs”).
